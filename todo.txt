Intead of getting just the first half of the forecast, get both and do a little bit of a data manipulation to combine them into one.
It could be one endpoint for the condensed version, and a separate one that gives more details.
On the frontend, look into adding tabs on the modal so that the detailedForecast field can be shown on one, then the highlights on the other.
For the daily forecast, could look into adding the small version of the icon, but it could be unnecessary.
